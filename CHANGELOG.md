## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Onboarded the repository to the Custodian guard: added `.custodian/config.yaml`,
  pre-commit and pre-push hooks under `.hooks/`, and drove the audit to zero findings.
- Split model tests into per-module files and added unit tests for `io.yaml_io` and
  `hooks.decisions`.
- Hardened code surfaces: `subprocess.run` timeout, `json.dumps(ensure_ascii=False)`,
  `NoReturn` annotations on hook entrypoints, and a shared YAML-model loader.
- Genericized references to a private consumer repository in tracked docs/examples.

## [0.3.0]

- Session anchoring via `cl session start/show/end` with RepoGraph-backed resolution.
- Claude Code hook adapters (`cl hook pre_tool_use`, `cl hook stop`) over pure
  decision functions.
- Pydantic schemas for `InvestigationCapsule`, `LoopCheckpoint`, `WorkerHandoff`,
  and `CLConfig`.
